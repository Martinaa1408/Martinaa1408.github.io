  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is <strong>Martina Castellucci</strong>, I am currently a 
    <strong>Master‚Äôs student in Bioinformatics</strong> at the University of Bologna.
    I hold a <strong>Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Biotechnology</strong> (2021‚Äì2024), 
    earned with <em>110/110 cum laude</em> at Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna.
  </p>

  <h2>üéì Academic Background</h2>
  <p>
    During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interdisciplinary foundation in
    biology, biotechnology, and biomedical sciences. My academic path integrated both
    theoretical knowledge and practical laboratory training, particularly in molecular and
    cellular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics.
  </p>
  <p>
    My <strong>bachelor thesis</strong>, entitled 
    <em>‚ÄúHistological and genetic adaptations of rat skeletal muscle induced in synthetic torpor‚Äù</em>,
    was carried out at the Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, in the laboratory of
    Physiology led by Prof. Roberto Amici. The project combined <strong>histological analysis</strong>
    with <strong>transcriptomic profiling (RNA-Seq)</strong> to investigate muscle preservation and
    gene regulation mechanisms in rats induced into synthetic torpor.
  </p>
  <p>
    This experience allowed me to gain hands-on skills in sample preparation, immunostaining,
    microscopy, and bioinformatic data analysis of differentially expressed genes.
  </p>

  <h2>üìö Master‚Äôs Studies</h2>
  <p>
    Since September 2024, I have been enrolled in the 
    <strong>International Master‚Äôs in Bioinformatics</strong> at the University of Bologna. 
    The program focuses on the development of computational methods for the analysis and 
    interpretation of biological data, emphasizing artificial intelligence, statistics, 
    and computational modeling of complex biological phenomena.
  </p>

  <h2>üåç Personal Interests & Goals</h2>
  <p>
    I am particularly interested in <strong>computational genomics</strong>, 
    <strong>transcriptomics</strong>, and the application of bioinformatics 
    to <strong>biomedical research</strong>. My long-term goal is to contribute 
    to the development of integrative approaches for understanding biological systems, 
    bridging experimental and computational sciences.
